Today, I just did some preliminary research and decided on some things for the printer.
I would like the toolhead to be able to be switched out very easily.
I also want it to be very "moddable in general."
The frame would have to fold or be taken apart very easily. Reasources: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EX62plOF-So&list=PLyYZUiBHD1QjaYx7eCEW8zXvsgwEbAykY, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qub5chyIQ0s
